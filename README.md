# figma-physics

Plugin code lives in `ui.html` and `plugin.ts`. It was a bit awkward getting to know Box2D's API in Figma, so I built a little sandbox in `sandbox.html` and `sandbox.js` to get to know the API.

This is really just glue code around: `https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js`! Check that project out, it's the C++ Box2D implementation compiled into asm.js :).
